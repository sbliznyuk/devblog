ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Simon, full-stack software engineer and technical writer.

I've built my first web-page at 16 in Macromedia Dreamweaver. It was "A quantum physics in simple terms" site. I remember I used some random googled JavaScript scenarios for dynamic menus and my site was starting through VisualBasic desktop app with drum'n'bass ðŸ˜‚. I had pretty much zero understanding of what's going on insideðŸ˜Š.

Since then I had received a Master's Degree in CS and managed to work in various positions: from a carwash worker to a chef's assistant in the restaurant, from a laboratory worker to an engineer in the software development company.

ðŸ“š I've always been a big fan of [learning](https://www.simonbliznyuk.com/things-i-dont-know) new technologies and discovering how things work.

Now besides my full-time job as a DevOps & QA engineer, I learn full-stack web development and write [open-source](https://github.com/semaphore8) code in my spare time.

I believe that documenting and sharing new knowledge helps to understand deeper the things you've researched. So I try to share my new findings that aren't well highlighted on the web. I'll be very happy knowing if someone would solve his problem by reading one of my posts.

ðŸ™Œ This blog is inspired by [Kalle Hallden's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWr0mx597DnSGLFk1WfvSkQ/channels), [Tania Rascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/)  and [Flavio Copes's](https://flaviocopes.com/) works.

## My setup

My current setup is pretty simple:

- Lenovo T520 laptop
- Samsung SA650 monitor
- Ikea desk
- Some random mouse and keyboard
- VSCode

## Soundcloud

ðŸŽ· Music is also my big passion and a huge part of my life. It helps me to go through the long coding sessions. [Here is the place](https://soundcloud.com/steamysunnyspace) where I try to give some structure to my latest findings.
