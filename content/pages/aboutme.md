Hello, I`m Simon, full-stack software engineer, working on open-source and writing about my vision to web-development.

I`ve built my first web-page at 16 on Macromedia Dreamweaver and some JavaScript. Now my most common tech stack is React, Django, GraphQL. 
This blog is inspired by [Tania Rascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/), [Kalle Hallden's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWr0mx597DnSGLFk1WfvSkQ/channels) and [Dan Abramov's](https://overreacted.io/) works.

Currently I`m working on:

- Lenovo T520 laptop
- Samsung A305 27' monitor
- Some random mouse and keyboard
