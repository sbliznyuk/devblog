## Initialize

First of all, you should add the `showCaptions` property to your `gatsby-remark-images` plugin, as it mentioned in [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/#options):

```jsx{10,11}
{
      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
      options: {
        plugins: [
          {
            resolve: "gatsby-remark-images",
            options: {
              maxWidth: 1440,
              linkImagesToOriginal: true,
              showCaptions: ['title'],
              markdownCaptions: true
            },
          },
        ],
      },
},
```

As a key's value you should pass an array that represents which image attribute should be used as a caption. Attributes are taken by the order that is set in this array. 

If you pass `['title', 'alt']` then Gatsby plugin will look for the `title` first and if there is no such attribute it will search for an `alt` tag.

If you want images only with a `title` tag to have caption text under it you should pass an `['title']` array.

By passing `markdownCaptions: true` property to plugin's options you are telling it to parse caption text as a markdown instead of raw text.

## Usage

You are ready to go now. Just pass the title text in double quotes as a second argument to markdown image element:

`![image-alt](image-url "(markdown) title")`

For example:

```python

```

As a result you'll get something like this:

![closed](../images/posts/1/ross-stone-G6dbyxMR9pA-unsplash.jpg "Photo by [Ross Stone](https://unsplash.com/@rs2photography?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/closed-road?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)")

## Possible pitfalls

If you have an error like this:

```bash
UNHANDLED REJECTION Cannot read property 'contentDigest' of undefined



  TypeError: Cannot read property 'contentDigest' of undefined

  - extend-node-type.js:57 htmlCacheKey
    [test]/[gatsby-transformer-remark]/extend-node-type.js:57:80

  - extend-node-type.js:337 Object.getHTML [as generateHTML]
    [test]/[gatsby-transformer-remark]/extend-node-type.js:337:42

  - index.js:150 getImageCaption
    [test]/[gatsby-remark-images]/index.js:150:21

  - index.js:306 _callee$
    [test]/[gatsby-remark-images]/index.js:306:54
```

you should update your Gatsby plugins:

```bash
npm up gatsby-transformer-remark gatsby-remark-images
npm audit fix
```

This is a [bug](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/16703) and it was fixed around november-december 2019.

## Styling ðŸ’…

By default, Gatsby image title has no proper CSS styling.

In order to make your title centered and smaller in size you can add to your CSS styles this properties:

```	scss
.gatsby-resp-image-figcaption {
    font-size: $base-font-size*0.6; // $base-font-size - font size SCSS variable
    text-align: center;
}
```

And if your images with title have borders in front of them, this properties can fix it:

```scss
figure {
    margin-inline-start: 0px;
    margin-inline-end: 0px;
}
```
