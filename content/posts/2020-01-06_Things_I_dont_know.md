## Introduction

> «Any man can do what another man has done»

Hello. I'm Simon. I learn tech and write about it.

My mind has always been very curious about new areas of knowledge and since I was in school I remember I always wanted to be more like an M-shape person in [T-shape](https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437) terminology.
