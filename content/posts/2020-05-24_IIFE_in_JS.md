JS expressions like this have always been very confusing for me:

```js
!function() {
    console.log('hi')
}();

// > hi
```

If you have no understanding of why it works and how then this article is for you.

Recently I came across the *IIFE* conception. *Immediately Invoked Function Expression* is JavaScript function, which runs immediately after the declaration.

This kind of expressions are also known as Self-Executing Anonymous Function:

```js
(function () {
    statements
})();

// or

(function () {
    statements
}());
```

IIFE contains of two parts:

- The anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the [`Grouping Operator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Grouping) `()`. This keeps inner variables within the IIFE idiom and prevents polluting the global scope.
- The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression `()` which signals JavaScript to directly interpret this.

You can call IIFE with parameters:

```js
((msg) => console.log(msg))('How was your day?');

// > How was your day?
```

When function declaration is enclosed in brackets, JS interprets it as a [function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function).

By the way, in order to make the function expression you can use any unary operator `+`,`-`, `!`, `~`:

```js

// Yes, it looks weird ðŸ¤”

-function() {console.log('hi')}();

// > hi

// or even
void function() {console.log('hi')}();

// > hi
```

> You can't use arrow functions with unary operators
