## Introduction

Hello. I'm Simon. I learn tech and write about it.

This is my first article in English ever.

My mind has always been very curious about new areas of knowledge and since I was in school I remember I always wanted to be more like a W-shape person. About 2 months ago I've decided to commit to the ["Learn in public"](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) concept by Shawn Wang, so here are my plans to the near future.
